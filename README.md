A wearable smart heating solution designed to monitor ambient and internal temperatures and dynamically regulate warmth using heating foils â€” controlled by a LilyPad microcontroller and temperature sensors.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing comfort in cold environments through a **Smart Heating Jacket**. It integrates:

- **DHT sensors** to measure both *internal* (inside the jacket) and *external* (ambient) temperatures.
- **Heating foil** to distribute controlled heat inside the jacket.
- **LilyPad microcontroller**, a wearable Arduino-compatible board ideal for textile integration.

## Features

- Textile-friendly with wearable electronics (LilyPad)
- Dual-temperature sensing (inside and outside)
- Automatic heat control based on temperature difference
- Energy-efficient regulation
- Modular code for easy expansion

## How It Works

1. The DHT sensors continuously monitor the temperature inside the jacket and the ambient temperature outside.
2. If the internal temperature is significantly lower than the target threshold (or in comparison with the outside), the LilyPad activates the **heating foil**.
3. The heat is distributed through the foil embedded in the jacket lining, raising the internal temperature gradually.
4. The system ensures that the heating stops when optimal comfort is achieved.
